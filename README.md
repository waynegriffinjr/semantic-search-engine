# Module 7 Project — Semantic Search Engine (Starter)

## Overview

Build a semantic search tool over a document collection. The tool loads, chunks,
embeds, and stores documents in ChromaDB, then provides a Streamlit interface
where users can type a question and see ranked results. You'll also run a
chunking experiment and document your findings.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Index the document corpus:
   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Streamlit search interface — your primary work file |
| `ingest.py` | Document loading, chunking, and ChromaDB storage |
| `search.py` | Search functions: query ChromaDB and rank results |
| `evaluate.py` | Evaluation framework: precision and recall |
| `docs/` | Starter document corpus (add your own documents here) |
| `chroma_data/` | Persistent ChromaDB storage (created on first run) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## Requirements

See the project brief on the course platform for the full rubric. Key sections:

1. **Document Ingestion** — load `docs/` folder, configurable chunk size/overlap,
   store in ChromaDB with source and chunk-index metadata
2. **Semantic Search** — ranked results with scores, configurable `n_results` and
   threshold, edge-case handling
3. **Streamlit Interface** — search input, sidebar controls (filter, re-index,
   result count), at least one `st.metric()`
4. **Chunking Experiment** — re-index at 2+ chunk sizes, run 5 identical queries,
   compare and document findings in this README
5. **Code Quality** — docstrings, modular files, working `requirements.txt`

## Chunking Experiment Results

> Fill this section in after completing the experiment.

**Chunk sizes tested:** _e.g. 200 chars vs 500 chars_

**Test queries:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Findings:**

_Which chunk size performed better overall, and why?_
